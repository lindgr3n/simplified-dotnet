# Getting Started with .NET 8

Welcome to the .NET 8 documentation. This section will guide you through the initial steps of setting up your development environment and creating your first .NET 8 project.

## Introduction to .NET 8

.NET 8 is the latest version of the .NET framework, offering enhanced features and improved performance for building modern web applications and APIs. It provides a unified platform for building applications that run on all major platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

Before diving into .NET 8, you need to set up your development environment. This involves installing the .NET 8 SDK and setting up your preferred code editor.

### Installing .NET 8 SDK

1. Visit the [.NET 8 SDK download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).
2. Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system.
3. Follow the installation instructions.

### Setting Up Your Code Editor

You can use any code editor or IDE that supports .NET development. [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) are popular choices.

- **Visual Studio**: A comprehensive IDE with robust .NET support.
- **Visual Studio Code**: A lightweight, extensible code editor.
- **Rider**: A cross-platform .NET IDE by JetBrains.

## Creating Your First .NET 8 Project

Once your environment is set up, it's time to create your first .NET 8 project.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to create a new .NET web application:
   ```bash
   dotnet new webapp -o MyFirstDotNetApp
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MyFirstDotNetApp
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
5. Open your web browser and navigate to \`http://localhost:5000\` to see your new app in action.

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your development environment and created your first .NET 8 application.
