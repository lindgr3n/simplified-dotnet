# Environmental variables

## Introduction

Environmental variables are a way to store sensitive information or configuration settings that can vary based on different environments 
such as local, development, staging, or production. In a .NET application, you can use environmental variables to store values such as database connection strings, 
API keys, and other sensitive information.

Because sensitive information should not be referenced in your code or repository you can use a `Secret Manager`. 
Secret Manager is a tool in Visual Studio that allows you to store sensitive data such as API keys, connection strings, and other secrets in a separate file that is 
not committed to source control. This file is called `secrets.json` and is stored in the user profile directory. You can think of this tool as
the same way you are storing sensitive information inside `.env` files. 
The Secret Manager tool is useful for storing sensitive data that you don't want to commit to source control, such as API keys, connection strings, and other secrets.

Default this file is located inside `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\UserSecrets\<user_secrets_id>\secrets.json` where `<user_secrets_id>` is a unique identifier for the project.
The unique identifier is generated when you create a new project and is stored in the `UserSecretsId` property in the project file.

Note: The Secret Manager tool does not encrypt the secrets that it stores. It simply stores them in a separate file that is not committed to source control.

## Setting up

If it is not already added you can use the following command to add the `UserSecretsId` property to the project file.

```bash
dotnet user-secrets init
```

To use the Secret Manager tool, you must first install the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.UserSecrets` package. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal.

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.UserSecrets
```

After you have installed the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.UserSecrets` package, you can use the Secret Manager tool to store sensitive data. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal.

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection" "Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;"
```

After you have added your sensitive data to the `secrets.json` file, you can access it in your code using the `ConfigurationBuilder` class. You can do this by adding the following code to your `Program.cs` file.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var movieApiKey = builder.Configuration["Movies:ServiceApiKey"];

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", () => movieApiKey);

app.Run();
```

Or by injecting the configuration in a service.

```csharp

public class MyService
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public MyService(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
    }

    public void DoSomething()
    {
        var movieApiKey = _configuration["Movies:ServiceApiKey"];
    }
}
```

## Mapping of secrets configuration

```JSON
{
  "Movies:ConnectionString": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=Movie-1;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true",
  "Movies:ServiceApiKey": "12345"
}
```

Then we have a class for the configuration.

```csharp
public class MoviesConfiguration
{
    public string ConnectionString { get; set; }
    public string ServiceApiKey { get; set; }
}
```

Then we can get the configuration in the `Program.cs` file.

```csharp
var moviesConfig = Configuration.GetSection("Movies").Get<MovieSettings>();
_moviesApiKey = moviesConfig.ServiceApiKey;
```


## Using cli for secrets

You can also use the command line to set and get secrets.

### Set secret

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "Movies:ServiceApiKey" "12345"
```

### Remove secret

```bash
dotnet user-secrets remove "Movies:ServiceApiKey"
```

### List secrets

```bash
dotnet user-secrets list
```

### Remove all secrets

```bash
dotnet user-secrets clear
```


## Using Environmental Variables

You can also use environmental variables to store sensitive data. You can do this by adding the sensitive data to the `.env` file and then accessing it in your code using the `Environment` class.

To add the sensitive data to the `.env` file, you can use the following format.

```env
CONNECTION_STRING=Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;
```

After you have added the sensitive data to the `.env` file, you can access it in your code using the `Environment` class.

```csharp
var connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("CONNECTION_STRING");
Console.WriteLine(connectionString);
```

This will return the value of the `CONNECTION_STRING` key in the `.env` file.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have learned how to use the Secret Manager tool to store sensitive data and how to access it in your code using the `ConfigurationBuilder` class. We have also learned how to use environmental variables to store sensitive data and how to access it in your code using the `Environment` class.
