Blazor apps that prerender their content on the server call OnInitializedAsync twice:

    Once when the component is initially rendered statically as part of the page.
    A second time when the browser renders the component.

OnSetParametersAsync is called whenever the component is rendered, whether it's the first time or subsequent times. 
This method is called after the component is initialized and after the component's parameters are set.
Fetch data here instead of OnInitializedAsync. Because second navigation will not call OnInitializedAsync.
Not to be interchanged with SetParametersAsync
